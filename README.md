A collection of sample apps for Voice API.

* [validate-callback-signature/node](https://github.com/sinch/voice-samples/tree/main/validate-callback-signature/node) A simple callback server that validates a [Callback Request signature](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/voice/api-reference/authentication/callback-signed-request/#callback-request-signing) contained in an incoming HTTP header for a call event and then responds with an example SVAML event for ICE and DICE. Can be used with the [Calling API](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/voice/) and [Sinch In-App Calling SDK](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/in-app-calling/).
